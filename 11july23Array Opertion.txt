Array Opertion

1] INSERTION

i) Replace index value

arr={31,1,5,9,6,9,4}
arr[2]=100
arr={31,1,100,9,6,9,4}

ii) Shift all elements to right side with one position
arr={31,1,5,8,6,9,4}
arr[7]=arr[6]
arr[6]=arr[5]
arr[5]=arr[4]
arr[4]=arr[3]
arr={31,1,5,8,8,6,9,4}

> only value i.e 8 is copied from index 3 to index 4 still value i.e 8 is avaliable at index 3
> we should start shifting from last index if shift from the index we want to insert then data at other index is replaced


pos--> is position at which we have to insert
n--> size of array
for(int k=n-2;k>=pos;k++)
 arr[k+1]=arr[k]

example:

arr={4,9, , ,}
insert 19 at index '0'
arr[3]=arr[2]
arr[2]=arr[1]
arr[1]=arr[0]
arr[0]=19
arr={19,4,9, }


arr={4,9,12,6}
insert 19 at index '1'
arr[3]=arr[2]
arr[2]=arr[1]
arr[1]=19
arr={4,19,9,12}


disadvantages:

1.if ther are no empty cell data will be lost
2.more shift operation
  n-1-pos times shift opertion should be peformed 



DELETION:

arr={1,2,3,4,5}
delete value at index 2
arr[2]=arr[3]
arr[3]=arr[4]

arr={1,2,4,5,5}

advantage:
>more then one value can be stored
>arrays are best if we want to perform more search opertion 

disadvantage:
>we can able to store similar data type values only
>take more shift opertion during insertion and deletion
>all elements stored in continous memory location

insertion disadvatage:
ther is looss of data in the

deletion disadvantage:
data is not realy deleted from memory
