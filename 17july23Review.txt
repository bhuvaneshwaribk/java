----------------------------------------------------
Number Guesser: Create a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number and the user has to guess it. if user Guess is incorrect, then give hints (weather the actual number is less than/ greater than guess number).

 

7. Menu based application on Array Operations: create an application which will display list of operations on array.
             --> Insert an element in first index 
             --> Insert an element in last index
             --> Insert an element in specified index
             --> Remove element from first index
             --> Remove element from last index
             --> Remove element from specified index
             --> Remove user eneted element
             --> Display all in ASC/DESC order


----------------------------------------------------




1)print middle number of an array and middle number in a digit

----------------------------------------
public static void main(String args[]){
    Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("enter a digit");
    int n=s.nextInt();
    int temp=n;
    int count=0;
    while(n>0){
      n/=10;
      count++;
    }
    System.out.println("no digit in a given number is="+count);
    int arr[]=new int[count];
    for(i=count-1;i>=0;i--){
      int r=temp%2;
      arr[i]=r;
      temp/=temp
    }
-----------------------------------------
//find the middle element and find middle digit of given number
import java.util.Scanner;
 
class Sample {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("enter a number:");
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int d, n1 = n;
    int count = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
      count++;
      n = n / 10;
    }
    int arr[] = new int[count];
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      d = n1 % 10;
      arr[i] = d;
      n1 = n1 / 10;
    }
    int middle = count / 2;
    if (count / 2 != 0) {
      System.out.println(" " + arr[middle - 1]);
    }
    if (count / 2 == 0)
      System.out.println(" " + arr[middle] + " " + arr[middle - 1]);
  }
 
}
------------------------------------------------------
2)print most repeated number in array



import java.util.*;

class Sample {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = s.nextInt();
    int count = 0, m,mostrepele=0;
    int  max = 0;
    int arr[] = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = s.nextInt();
    }

    
    for (m = 0; m < n; m++) {
      count = 1;
      for (int p = m + 1; p < n; p++) {
        if (arr[p] == arr[m] ) {
          count++;
        

        }

      }
      

      if (count > max){
        max = count;
        leastrepele=arr[m];
        System.out.println(moststrepele+"is least repeated element");

      }
    }


  }
}



3)print least repeated number in array


import java.util.*;

class Sample {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = s.nextInt();
    int count = 0, m,leastrepele=0;
    int  min = 9;
    int arr[] = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = s.nextInt();
    }

    
    for (m = 0; m < n; m++) {
      count = 1;
      for (int p = m + 1; p < n; p++) {
        if (arr[p] == arr[m] ) {
          count++;
        

        }

      }
      

      if (count < min){
        min = count;
        leastrepele=arr[m];
        System.out.println(leastrepele+"is least repeated element");

      }
    }


  }
}


4)search an element in an array

import java.util.*;
class example{

public static void main(String arg[]){
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("enter the size of array");
int n=s.nextInt();
System.out.println(" enter element to search");
int ele=s.nextInt();
int arr[]=new int[n];
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   arr[i]=s.nextInt();
for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
   if(arr[j]==ele)
     System.out.println(ele+"is present at index"+j);

}
}
}

5)to print numbers in reverse

import java.util.*;
class example{
public static void main(String args[]){
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
int n=sc.nextInt();
int i=n;
while(i>=1){
Sytem.out.println(i)
i--;
}



6)check valid aadar number
7)print all even digits in a number

import java.util.*;
class example{

public static void main(String arg[]){
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
int n=s.nextInt();
while(n>0){
int digit=n%10;
if(digit%2==0)
 System.out.println(digit+" is even");
n=n/10;
}
}

8)frist half array into ascending and second half array into decending
9)to print armstrong no in range 2000 to 5000
